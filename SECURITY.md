# Security Policy

Please notify us as soon as possible if you discover a potential security issue, and we will make every effort to resolve it promptly. Allow us a reasonable amount of time to address the issue before disclosing it publicly or to any third parties. If necessary, we may disclose the issue publicly before it is fully resolved.

## Supported Versions
We typically do not apply patches to versions that are more than two releases behind the current major version. However, for critical issues, exceptions may be made. We strive to keep our users secure, but we encourage you to always use the latest version.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
You can contact us via email at security@kryptopass.org.  
For less sensitive issues, you may also open an issue or submit a pull request on GitHub.
